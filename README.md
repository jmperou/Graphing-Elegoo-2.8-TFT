# What you will need...
  1. Elegoo 2.8" TFT Touch Screen display (https://www.elegoo.com/products/elegoo-2-8-inches-tft-touch-screen)
  2. Arduino Uno or Mega
  3. Mini USB cable to connect your Arduino Uno or Mega to your computer
  4. Elegoo Libraries (see instructions)

# Instructions
  1. Install your Elegoo 2.8" TFT Touch Screen onto your Arduino Mega or Uno per the instructions included with the display
  2. Connect your Arduino Uno or Mega to your computer via usb cable
  3. Download and install the Elegoo Libraries onto your PC from here: https://github.com/jmperou/Graphing-Elegoo-2.8-TFT/tree/main/Elegoo_Libraries
  4. Copy and Paste the code from either Graphing.ino or Graph.ino into your project in your Arduino IDE
  5. Upload to your display and enjoy
 
# Notes
  - Some of the example graphs included in Graphing.ino and Graph.ino aren't completely shown (they clip off of the display). This is just a positioning/size issue which can be resolved by modifying the X/Y positions and sizes of the graphs in the options of the function to your desire.
